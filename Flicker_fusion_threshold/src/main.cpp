/* Project to measure flicker fusion threshold using
 teensy 3.2 microcontroller.
The requirements of the project are:
 A flashing LED should serve as the visual stimulus.
 A potentiometer should be used to adjust the LEDâ€™s blink
 frequency.
 A button should be connected which when pressed a hardware
 interrupt is to be triggered and the currently set blink
 frequency should be displayed.
 No delay() function to be used and
 Debouncing of the button to be done*/
